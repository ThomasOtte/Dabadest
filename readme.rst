*******************
Server Requirements
*******************

PHP version 5.6 or newer is recommended.

It should work on 5.3.7 as well, but I strongly advise you NOT to run
such old versions of PHP, because of potential security and performance
issues, as well as missing features.

Installation

1. Load the dabadest.sql that resides inside the Database folder into your database
2. Enter your database user information into application/config/database.php.dist
3. Change the filename from "database.php.dist" to "local.php"
